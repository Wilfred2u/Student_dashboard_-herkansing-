                Down here you see a student dashboard, a chart in fact. It contains the outcome of 56 assingments,
                which are made by ten students.<br /> Each student has rated the funniness (purple)
                and difficultiness (yellow) of each of the 56 assingments, on a scale of 1 to 5.
            </p>
            <p>
                The chart is adjustable, you can check and uncheck the students to see their individual rates and switch
                from bar-style to line-style and vice-versa.
            </p>
